        <h1 class="main-heading">Creating The Portfolio</h1>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p class="sub-para">
          The creation of the portfolio consisted of evaluating potential
          portfolio designs, the best-suited one for the portfolio. Overall, the
          creation of the portfolio was rather interesting as most of the
          concepts used to make the website was from the content taught in the
          lectures. The lecture content is mainly what dominates the portfolio.
          Other aspects of the portfolio such as the animations have been
          referenced and their application to the portfolio was to make it more
          aesthetically pleasing. <br />
          <br />
          While it was important to make the page pleasing to view,
          functionality was also an important aspect to consider. This would be
          involving the screen size and whether it would be still be easily
          usable on a mobile phone or tablet. Is the font legible, if the images
          are not quite clear is there any alt text for people to see what it
          was supposed to be? All these where considered when making the
          portfolio.
        </p>

        <h3 class="min-heading">Home</h3>
        <p class="sub-para">
          This is a introduction to what both portfolio and I as a person have
          to offer. The intention of the typing animation was to give a good
          impression and brief introduction. To keep it short and precise.
          <br />
          The layout of this page went through more change compared to the other
          pages, the initial design and the thought process of the home page was
          to have a very simple and plain introducion into the webpage. A
          screenshot of how it initially was supposed to look below this
          paragraph verse how it finally looked after some deliberation.

        <!-- About  -->
        <h3 class="min-heading">About</h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          This would be a proper introduction to who Tariro Gumbo is. This page
          may be shown more about how much I have learnt from this unit. My
          application concepts learnt were applied in the About Section more
          compared to the other four sections. The references for the content,
          that some information was taken from and aplied to the this section
          are placed at the end of the document after the html losing tag.
          <br />
          In the work experince section the use of lists and span tags dominated
          the section and understanding how to style a webpage has been
          informative.More time went into the style sheet than it did on the
          javascript which was used to create the menu toggle for use on
          different devices and screen sizes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="min-heading">Projects</h3>
        <p class="sub-para">
          The projects page or Projects Gallery as i have so renamed it on my
          portfolio is purely for the inclass exercises that we worked on. The
          format has not really changed here. The styling has mostly changed for
          the footer, header and navigation bar. The color theme as well.
          <br />
          An interesting discovery i made with this page would be inserting the
          images for the individual projects. The size proportion for each image
          to still be properly viewed on different devices without disorting
          their ratio was intriguing. Insightful.
        </p>
        <h3 class="min-heading">Contacts</h3>
        <p class="sub-para">
          The initial intention of the contacts is create a page in which has my
          contact details and my social media sites such as linked in, a link to
          my github, instagram and twitter. Hence the layout and the phrase"
          Reach out if my portfolio was impactful" <br />
          <br />
          Of Course after going through the assignent outline, i realised a form
          would be a necessary addition to the page hence the current order. I
          was able to maintain the original order and was able to add a form to
          beside content on how to reach me. Having placed the form it made no
          sense to leave my email and telephone at the bottom as it shows in the
          below pictures.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Challenges</h2>
        <p class="sub-para">
          The challenges that I faced were mostly due to the styling of the
          portfolio. The chllenges were solved eventually although thre might be
          some parts I have missed or did not take notice to. However the most
          challenging would have been the screen sizing for different devices.
          Making generic sizings might not help in some cases since the
          dimensions differ with each phone and chances are the dimensions I
          used for a tablet, phone or a browser would differ on the device.

        <ol class="ch-list">
          <li>
            Javascript Typing Animation: it was a matter of the typing
            animation, which I later got the hang of and fixed the code in the
            js file, otherwise that would currently not be on the home page. In
            the initial design the home page had my social media icons until the
            typing animation appeared to be in conflict with the background
            picture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact Page: There was problem I encountered in the begining since
            I was reluctant to put a form on the page but wanted to maintain it
            as it was.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navbar: The navbar was intially horizontal at the top of the page
            which is very different from how it is now. It was different on each
            of the pages On some pages it was sticky while on other pages it was
            fixed. At the time it seemed like a design flaw. Therefore I made
            the navigation bar and the footer into a vertical navigation bar.
          </li>

          If you are interested in contacting my contact information has been
          linked in the navigation bar or you can leave a message in the form
          below. The other ways to reach would be through email or by telephone
          which i have also included below.
